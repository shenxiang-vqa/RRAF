# RRAF
This work proposes an effective Visual Object Relationship Reasoning and Adaptive Fusion (RRAF) model to address the shortcomings of existing VQA model research. The model can simultaneously model visual objectsâ€™ position, appearance, and semantic features and uses an adaptive fusion mechanism to achieve fine-grained multi-modal reasoning and fusion.
